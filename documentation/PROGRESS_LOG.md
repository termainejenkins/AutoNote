## Current Status
- Phase 1 is complete with the implementation of all core services and Docker Compose setup
- Phase 2: Frontend Development is well underway, with authentication, notes, content processing, and user profile features implemented
- **Frontend and backend are now communicating successfully. Registration, login, and core note flows are working.**
- **The full stack (frontend and backend) is now running successfully via Docker Compose. CORS and line ending issues were resolved. The app is confirmed to be working end-to-end.**
- Ready to expand automated testing, polish features, and prepare for production deployment

## Next Steps
1. Polish and complete any missing features (advanced note organization, AI features, etc.)
   - [ ] Implement advanced note organization (folders, tags, search improvements)
   - [ ] Finalize AI features (summarization, key point extraction, question generation)
   - [ ] Complete and test the ContentProcessor and Dashboard pages
   - [ ] Ensure protected routes and user profile management are robust
2. Expand frontend and backend test coverage (unit, integration, E2E)
   - [ ] Write unit tests for backend services
   - [ ] Write unit tests for frontend components
   - [ ] Implement integration tests for service interactions
   - [ ] Add end-to-end (E2E) tests for full user flows
3. Improve accessibility and user experience
   - [ ] Audit and improve accessibility (a11y) across the app
   - [ ] Add user feedback (toasts, error messages, loading spinners)
   - [ ] Polish UI for usability and responsiveness
4. Update documentation
   - [ ] Restore or update architecture, requirements, and prompting guides as needed
   - [ ] Add or update API documentation
   - [ ] Update user and deployment guides
5. Prepare for deployment and automate CI/CD
   - [ ] Review and finalize Docker and docker-compose setups
   - [ ] Ensure environment variables are production-ready
   - [ ] Set up or refine CI/CD pipelines for all services
   - [ ] Prepare for production deployment (infrastructure, monitoring, rollback procedures)

### Immediate Priorities Checklist
- [ ] Test and debug the full authentication and note-taking flow from frontend to backend
- [ ] Fix any integration issues between frontend and backend services
- [ ] Implement and test content extraction and AI summarization features
- [ ] Begin browser extension MVP: set up project, implement basic content capture, connect to API
- [ ] Expand and run automated tests (unit, integration, E2E)
- [ ] Update documentation to reflect current architecture and next steps

## Notes
- All core services are now containerized and can be run locally using Docker Compose
- Monitoring stack is configured with Prometheus and Grafana
- Database and Redis services are properly configured for all microservices
- Environment variables are set up for development
