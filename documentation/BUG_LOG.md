### [BUG-002] CORS Error: Frontend-Backend Communication Blocked
#### Status
- [ ] New
- [ ] In Progress
- [x] Fixed
- [x] Verified
- [x] Closed

#### Priority
- [x] High
- [ ] Medium
- [ ] Low

#### Environment
- OS: All
- Browser: All
- Version: All
- Service: API Gateway (Backend)

#### Description
Frontend requests to the backend (API Gateway) were blocked by the browser due to missing CORS headers, resulting in errors like:
"Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'http://localhost:8000/notes' from origin 'http://localhost:3000' has been blocked by CORS policy."

#### Steps to Reproduce
1. Start frontend and backend separately
2. Attempt to access backend API from frontend
3. Observe CORS error in browser console

#### Expected Behavior
Frontend should be able to communicate with backend API

#### Actual Behavior
Requests are blocked by browser CORS policy

#### Root Cause
CORS middleware in the API Gateway was not configured to allow requests from the frontend origin

#### Solution
Configured FastAPI's CORSMiddleware in the API Gateway to allow requests from 'http://localhost:3000'

#### Prevention
- Always configure CORS for local development and production
- Document CORS setup in backend service guides

### [BUG-003] Prettier/Line Ending Build Failure in Docker
#### Status
- [ ] New
- [ ] In Progress
- [x] Fixed
- [x] Verified
- [x] Closed

#### Priority
- [x] High
- [ ] Medium
- [ ] Low

#### Environment
- OS: Windows (with Docker)
- Service: Frontend (React)

#### Description
Docker build failed due to Prettier errors about CRLF (Windows) line endings, e.g.:
"Delete `‚êç` prettier/prettier"

#### Steps to Reproduce
1. Edit files on Windows (default CRLF line endings)
2. Run 'docker-compose up --build'
3. Observe build failure due to Prettier errors

#### Expected Behavior
Build should succeed regardless of OS line endings

#### Actual Behavior
Build fails due to line ending mismatch

#### Root Cause
Files had CRLF line endings, but Prettier and Docker (Linux) expect LF

#### Solution
Ran 'npx prettier --write .' in the frontend directory to convert all files to LF

#### Prevention
- Added instructions to use Prettier to fix line endings
- Recommended setting Git to use LF via core.autocrlf or .gitattributes
